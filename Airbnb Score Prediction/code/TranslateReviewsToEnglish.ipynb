      "Error review: i do not recommend anyone staying here because the hosts are unreliable and untrustworthy. save your time, money, and peace of mind. i love airbnb and have stayed in over 30 airbnbs in over 15 countries, and this was a terrible airbnb that was so bad it makes me really hesitate to use airbnb again. my husband and i loved everyday of our vacation but the hosts of this airbnb ruined this part of our vacation. i messaged carol prior to booking, about 1 month prior to our trip, letting her know specifically that we would arrive around 8:30-9pm and need to store our bags the next day until 5-5:30pm. i asked her if this was okay, i would like to book. she stated this would work and i booked. the night prior to our stay, i messaged her asking if i could do laundry there for a few items of clothing. she said yes, we will be home in 5 minutes. i thought this was really strange as if she didn't know what was going on. i politely reminded her i was coming tomorrow and was asking in advance. she asked me to text her when i was at the airport. this didnt make sense as we were coming from south/west ireland and i had already told her time of arrival prior to booking. late afternoon on day of arrival, i told her we were coming from galway and would be arriving as previously stated 830-9pm (we were actually even running earlier than this) and also asked her when dublin restaurants close (since we were not sure if online hours were accurate based on another stay). she responded and stated that they would not be home until after 10pm because i did not notify them of my arrival time and restaurants close at 10pm. i was really, really upset about this but did not argue with her here. i did not want to confront my host and feel unsafe and uncomfortable where i was staying that night or deal with the hassle of finding a hotel and dealing with an airbnb dispute. she was blatantly lying - our previous exchange clearly stated my arrival time. we would 100% not have booked if she couldn't meet that. moreover, her check in time is listed as after 2pm so why book someone if you wont be home until after 10pm. we were only in ireland for 4 days for our 1 year wedding anniversary and had a really tight itinerary. we drove for over 10 hours that day so we could make it to dublin in time and experience a friday dinner and nightlife in dublin (our only night there). we planned to drop off our bags, return our rental car to the airport, and then have dinner and enjoy temple bar. we did not want to drive in dublin city center. we had to scramble to change our plans last minute, including not being able to eat at the restaurant we wanted (because we thought it closed early) or experience temple bar and had to deal with the stress of driving and parking in a new city (opposite road driving, no parking, not knowing layout of the city, etc), which sucked up a lot of our time. we barely had time to eat dinner, in which we were informed by several restaurants that they close around midnight. i don't know why she stated 10pm, which greatly influenced our plans. instead of enjoying temple bar like we wanted, we got to see it for a few minutes. it was incredibly disappointing and stressful. they messaged me around 1030 telling me they were home. we got to their place a little bit after 11 because we had issues finding our car again in dublin and airbnb directions kept directing us elsewhere. the pin they gave us wouldn't load on my maps. when we arrived, i was really, really upset but did not say anything again due to safety and comfort reasons. we needed to return our car right away. we were met by carol's boyfriend. i reminded the host that we needed to leave our bags until 5pm the next day. he stated oh thats not good because no one may be here. he then goes on to recommend to me to do luggage storage in the city because it will be easier on me. i said i had messaged carol a month ago telling her my arrival time and needing to leave my bags there until 5pm and she said that was okay, so why is he telling me something different now. he tells me that he knows all that because he read the messages. so that further confirmed to me that they lied to me when they said they didn't know about my arrival time since it was clearly stated in the previous message that he just admitted he read. i believe they definitely knew and selfishly put whatever plans they had ahead of our arrangement thinking it would be no big deal. he proceeds to try to sell me to get luggage storage in the city for *my benefit*. i asked him straight out so are you telling me you can't hold my luggage. he does not say yes or no but simply goes on to manipulatively say he believes it is best for me. he was sooooo shady !!!! i had already researched luggage storage in the city, and we wanted to leave our bags at the airbnb. i had not booked at other places because they could not hold our baggage. i had not seen or talked to carol herself either - it was all dealing with her bf. i tell him im sorry for trying to hurry the conversation but we need to return the car prior to midnight. he continues to talk selfishly and at a certain point i tell him, we need to go. further making matters worse, because we were delayed by checking in, finding... \n",

      "Error review: what a fantastic find. i am so glad i found the penthouse. it was perfect for my three-week work-and-play stay exploring dublin and surrounds.let's start with location. i took to telling folks i was staying in dun laoghaire (pronounced dun leary), though i'm not sure technically what 'burb the penthouse is in. downtown dun laoghaire is a 10-minute bus ride away (the 45a bus that takes you there picks up right in front of the apartments and runs about every 30 minutes). there is so much to do simply in and around dun laoghaire. frank gave me some great tips and i'm so glad i visited the library (where i worked when i wanted to work outside of the apartment) and killiney hill (if you go, make sure to stop by the druids chair afterward - they pour a great pint). i also went to sandycove to see the james joyce tower and museum and forty foot, which is a short walk from people's park in dun laoghaire (which is worth a visit in itself). i also really enjoyed my day exploring dalkey (i recommend the queens bar, dillon's park, and checking out the programming at dalkey castle).one of the many reasons i was visiting dublin was for bloomsday. the proximity of the apartment to the james joyce tower and fitzgeralds of sandycove made it great for that. it was also really easy to get into the city center via the 7a bus or the dart. it takes about 45 minutes to an hour either way, depending on where exactly you're going. i went to the city centre several times--for bloomsday and on other days to check out the book of kells, national gallery, museum of literature, guinness storehouse, and other sites. i also spent a day in howth, which is an easy ride from dun laoghaire on the dart.nearby resources i recommend checking out include the hotel right next door to the apartment (i got their irish breakfast a couple of different times and was very happy with it; they also serve lunch and dinner and have a nice bar); the circle k across the street, where you can get essentials in a hurry; the supervalu grocery store at the killiney shopping center about a ten-minute walk away (it was the only place i wanted or needed to grocery shop--i especially loved their irish cheese section!); the graduate, the pub/restaurant next door to supervalu; dunphys, my favorite pub in dun laoghaire (currently drinks only); penney's near the dun laoghaire shopping center (where you can find clothing and accessories for affordable prices); and, again, the lexicon library. they have a great event space in the basement (where i saw a free theatre performance) and a coffee shop that makes a great cappuccino. the views of the piers (which are also worth visiting and walking) and howth in the distance are incredible.as for the apartment, it was perfect for my needs. the guest room is spacious and relaxing with a lovely calm atmosphere. the bed is very comfortable and the desk is one of the best i've had in an airbnb. it was a great place to get work done. the shower was nice and hot with good pressure. frank and jackie have thoughtfully outfitted the room with many essentials including a hair dryer, an electric kettle for tea, a drying rack for if/when you do laundry, and a fan that works nicely in tandem with an open window to keep the room fresh and cool. one of the best features of the apartment is the huge balcony. frank was nice enough to loan me one of their outdoor table-and-chair sets so i ended up taking many meals and morning teas out there. the view of the wicklow mountains is fantastic. the pics i sent home made everyone jealous!i had no problem using the kitchen when i needed to. it also has just about everything that you need. you're given ample fridge and freezer space for a week or more's worth of groceries and have access to a stove, cooktop, microwave, cupboard for your dry goods, and a drying rack for your dishes.frank is friendly, helpful, and easy to talk to. i enjoyed chatting with him and really enjoyed having him as a host. in nearly every case he was able to help when i had a question or request. my only notable issue during my stay was the tension and awkwardness i experienced with jackie. she both seemed to be going through something personal that had nothing to do with me and to have decided she didn't like me and didn't want to talk to me, based on the shift in her behavior toward me about two days in. this may have been a unique situation and may not affect future guests. in my case it was significant enough to need to mention it for this review to be fully honest but not significant enough to make my time at the penthouse anything less than fantastic.this was a total five-star find and a tremendous value for the affordable price frank and jackie charge. the only reason i might not recommend it is if you need to be closer than an hour's bus ride (prob 30-40 minute taxi ride) to the city centre. in any other case, i highly recommend staying here and taking the time to check out the seaside towns nearby as well as central dublin. i would easily stay here again!! \n",

      "Error review: i had a mixed experience at this stay. i'll talk first about the things that bothered me (which may not bother you); then about the positive aspects, which were significant. first, when someone is rated as a super host, there are certain things i have come to expect. one is readily available wifi information. when i arrived, my host was at work, and there was no wifi information in my room. i couldn't contact him to ask for it because -well, i didn't have wifi (looking back, if hadn't been so tired, i would have looked for my host's phone number, though i don't know if he would have been available by phone.) this was extremely frustrating because after a ten hour flight, serious sleep deprivation, hauling my luggage back and forth on the sidewalks outside the airport because of conflicting information about where the bus stop was, (the information my host had kindly provided was only partially correct), i was utterly exhausted and desperately wanted to connect with my family. i also felt super grungy and really wanted to take a shower, but didn't see any towels in the bathroom so i used one of my shirts as a towel. already, i was feeling not at all welcomed. then i noticed a couple of scraps of paper on the floor left by the previous guess, and my sense of being disregarded was exacerbated. what about all those \"immaculate\" reviews my host had received? there was nothing in the room to counterbalance the shortcomings--no little vase of flower, no carafe of fresh water and a glass, no map of dublin, no brochures about local sites, no menus from local restaurants. i think these extras convey a welcome that i always appreciate. i don't need them, really, but in this situation, their absence exaggerated my sense of my host not really caring. granted, all this is seen and interpreted through the eyes of a weary traveler; however, i think the shortcomings i've mentioned are basics that any host, especially a super host, need to attend to. brian, my host, had let me know that he would be home by 6, which meant a three-hour wait. i tried to stay awake until he got home, but finally i just had to sleep. so i wrote him a note and asked him to leave the wifi information outside my door, and asked him if i was expected to bring my own towels, as that could have been the case and i didn't remember. when i got up from my nap, the wifi info and two towels were outside my door, but there was no note of apology. perhaps cultural differences played a role here. after all, i am from the u.s. and visiting ireland for the first time. maybe apologies aren't offered as readily as in the states? the next morning, when i made the bed, i discovered that what i had thought was a small blanket at the end of the bed was actually a towel. had there been a washcloth on top of it, i would have recognized the towel, but in my exhaustion, i just didn't. then i noticed that the overhead light in the bathroom didn't work; thankfully, the light around the mirror did. i mentioned the non-working light to my host and expected him to say something like i'll be up to fix it right away, but he simply nodded and asked me if the light around the mirror worked. looking back, i see that i could have asked him to come and fix the overhead light; on the other hand, i expect a super host to take the initiative. the most uncomfortable experience was preparing my breakfast, sitting down at the table to eat, and noticing that the host's dog, a lovable bulldog, had pooped in the corner of the kitchen near the table. my host came into the kitchen about 15 minutes later and i told him about it. he quickly scooped up the mess and said something like training was going slowly for the dog. again, no apology. when i first arrived, there was one other air bnb guest; but the next day or so two more guests arrived, and i decided that when i went out i would lock the door to my room. there was a key in the lock, a very old key, as this is a remodeled victorian home. i locked the door successfully, and was able to unlock it when i returned, but unable to get the bolt to fully retract. this meant i couldn't close the door completely. i mentioned this to brian and he said something like he'd never used the key and not to worry about it. that was fine with me, but the fact that the door couldn't be closed all the way meant that his lovable dog (truly a sweet dog - i'm not being sarcastic) wandered into my room while i was asleep and started rummaging around my suitcase, which woke me up, which was not good at all because i hadn't been able to fall asleep until the small hours of the morning and really needed to sleep in. taken individually, no one of these things is that awful, but put together, what i experienced was a lack of concern for my well-being and comfort. now for the positives. the room was quiet, as he had said it would be (i've found that hosts have different ideas of what quiet means), the bed was super comfortable, the pillows and quilt soft and fluffy, and the dark-patterned shades almost made my sleep mask unnecessary. here are the contradictions to my sense of not feeling welcomed. brian has an exceptional talent for relating to people. he was quite solicitous about the fact that it was taking me some time to get my circadian rhythms on track. he obliged my request to be super quiet when coming and going. he checked in with me later to... \n",

      "Error review: unfortunately, my experience here was by far the least positive i've had on airbnb so far. the heating, the appallingly by furniture, omitting some essential information and the interaction with my host's husband were some of the issues that i'm going to address.my host wasn't home when i arrived which is ok. she described in a message how to get to the room that was prepared for me and it wasn't the same one shown in the pictures but it provided the same \"amenities\" and it had the same amount of space so that wasn't a problem either.the problems: 1. the room: i had paid eur81 per night and that sure wasn't worth it. the furniture in the room was just so cheap and didn't look nice at all. i was visiting dublin for the first time and just really needed a place to stay with the basic amenities since i spent the days out exploring the city. i didn't expect luxury but that was the first time on airbnb that it really felt like i was in a room furnished with stuff of such low quality that it was not fine for what i had paid.the shower couldn't be used while the one of the room next to mine was in use. there was no information at all about it in the announcement. there were sheets of paper hanging on the doors inside the room saying that both showers couldn't be used simultaneously with my host's telephone number of there were any issues. the shower wasn't and built in one but a small one hanging on the wall with very low pressure. the rack to hang the shower head on was old and didn't hold its position so that the water stream would turn to the wall. 2. the heating: the whole house was cold and i got sick. it was mid april and clearly still cold. the heating would only be turned on for a couple of hours during the nigh and on the second day not even the water in the sink and in the shower were heating up enough. i was lucky that i had taken a shower after returning to the apartment because my host wasn't home and it took her a long time to react to my message regarding the issue. after returning to the apartment the radiator in the bedroom was warm but the other ones in the rest of the rooms of the house i had access to were not working. in fact they didn't work throughout my whole stay. this is definitely the least a host should provide when renting a room on airbnb and failing to do so as well as not properly reacting to solve the issue after a complaint is just unacceptable. 3. the dinning room: there was a small fridge in beside the dinner table, a kettle and a microwave in the dinning room. since it wasn't part of the agreement that i would have access to the kitchen, i supposed there would be enough bottled water to use for a tea or coffee but just there wasn't. there were two bottles of water in the fridge and that was all. in the last message prior to my check in, the host also said \"and there's tea and coffee\" in the dinner room\" when in fact none of that was there. 4. invasion of privacy: i had only communicated with my host via text messages and met her once for 5 minutes on the second day. after messaging her concerning the issue with the heating, i seemed to have become an inconvenience and she simply asked when i would check out on the last day because she had a reservation request with an early check-in wish. my response was just that i still didn't know. i understand that the host and the guests can agree on having different check-in and checkout times than the ones in the announcement but it isn't an obligation. the check out time otherwise is generally 11 am, as it was the case there, and i intended to make use of that.on the last morning around 9 am, i was packing my bags in the bedroom and a man i didn't know just knocked on the door, opened it (i hadn't locked it because i was there and didn't think it was necessary), entered the room and said \"i want to know when you're leaving\". i was just so surprised in the moment that i just said \"isn't the checkout time 11 am?\" and he just went away. i just started wondering what that meant and who the guy was and was really scared at the moment. specially because i had never seen that guy and still could hear him stomping in the corridor in front of the room after leaving for a couple of minutes.i thought i would just pack my things and bring them downstairs as soon as possible which i did. while i was standing in the living room the guy just passed by again and didn't say a word to me. i texted my host about it and reported the situation to airbnb's customer service. later my host texted me saying, that that was her husband and that she considered it to be \"perfectly fine to ask someone when he's leaving.\" of course it is, when you've been previously at least informed about that. otherwise it's just a stranger entering the room and that really scared me at the moment. the whole strange atmosphere in the house added to that. i am honestly surprised about the positive reviews and this experience has taught me to rely on them so much. i also ask myself if they haven't been fabricated to a certain extent.fortunately i had always had great experiences with my previous stays and even nice and pleasant interactions with my hosts. i didn't see this coming and i hope no one has \n",
